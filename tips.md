# Leatherworking Tips and Notes

## Buying leather

Leather comes in a lot of configurations, and can be a bit confusing. Here's
what I'm learning about getting the right leather for the job.

### Veg tan vs. chrome tan

People seem to equte veg tan with quality. I don't know about that. The facts
seem to be:

-   Chrome tanned leather can't be worked, most notably, you can't burnish the
    edges. So if you use it where edges are exposed, be ready to use edge paint.
-   Chrome tanned leather is generally softer than veg tan. This can make it
    harder to hand sew, I guess, though I haven't tried yet.
    
### Picking the cut

Tandy sells a lot of double shoulders. These tend to be 10 - 12 square feet.
The problem is that there almost always seems to be scarring down the spine at
the shoulder. So while it's cheaper to get a double shoulder than to get a side,
the side is less likely to have major blemishes in the middle of the piece.

### Weights

Pieces tend to be sold in a weight range. For example, Tandy most commonly sells
2-3 oz., 4-5 oz., 6-7 oz., and 8-9 oz. Things vary quite a lot within their
ranges, so be sure to bring a gauge if you're particular.
