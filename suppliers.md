# Leatherworking suppliers
This list is my take on the places to get tools, supplies, and hardware for leatehrworking.

It's good to keep in mind my biases:
-   I live in the USA.
-   I am generally more concerned with quality than I am with economy.
-   I'm kind of a snob, even though I try to have a good reason for each item of snobbery.

## Tools

### [Tandy Leather Factory](http://tandyleather.com)
Tandy is the 500 pound gorilla in the US for leathercraft. They tend to be pretty expensive, and
sometimes their stuff is of dubious quality, but you generally don't go wrong by shopping here first.
They are aimed at the all-around market, with an emphasis on hobbyists and a lot of beginner-friendly
offerings.

### [Fine Leatherworking](http://www.fineleatherworking.com/)
This site offers *high-end tools* as well as supplies and courses. It's a good place to find tools in the
European trandition (though many seem to be made in East Asia these days). Expect to get quality and pay
accordingly.

### [Goods Japan](http://goodsjapan.com/)
Good source for Japanese leatherworking tools and supplies. In many cases, what you can get here is at
least as high quality as Tandy at lower prices.

### [Weaver Leather](http://www.weaverleathersupply.com/)
A general leatherworking supply shop. Aimed at professionals more than hobbyists, with quality and prices
to match.

## Supplies



## Hardware

### [The Buckle Guy](http://buckleguy.com)
The Buckle Guy has the best selection of hardware (buckles, yes, but much more) on the web. Three things
about the site excite me:

-   Offers a wide selection of solid, cast metal hardware (brass and steel)
-   Prices are very good, especially when compared to quality.
-   Bulk discounts start at quantities as low as 10, making the prices even better.

They also have tools and supplies, but I have yet to try those, as there are so many other options readily
at hand.
